// Challenge 4: Bitwise Operators
// Write a program that uses bitwise AND (&) to check which tea types are in stock. The stock is encoded in an integer (1 for Green, 2 for Black, 4 for Oolong). Allow the user to check availability by inputting the tea type (1, 2, or 4), and display a message saying whether that tea is in stock or not.
