# Problems on Function Overloading

1. **Problem 1:**\
   You have to generate a single sum() function which can take two, three or four parameters and will return sum of all the numbers. Suppose if we are given with 2 integer values a and b we have to return (a+b), if given 3 integer values a, b and c we have to return (a+b+c) and similarly for 4 numeric values (a+b+c+d).

2. **Problem 2:**\
   Function Overloading for Sum of Numbers

   Write 3 Overloaded functions for

   1. Sum of 2 integers
   2. Sum of 2 Floats
   3. Sum of 3 integers

3. **Problem :**\
   Function Overloading for Min of Numbers
   Write Overloaded Functions for finding Minimum of numbers.

   Implement following functions

   1. Minimum of 2 integers
   2. Minimum of 3 integers
   3. Minimum of 2 floats
